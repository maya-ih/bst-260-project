To reproduce the results of this project, ensure all files are placed in their respective folders as specified. The wrangling.qmd script, located in the code folder, processes the raw input files <covid-data.csv> and <state-pop.xlsx> from the data folder to generate the cleaned dataset <cleaned-project-data.csv>. This cleaned data is essential for the main analysis and is used by the final-project.qmd script. Additionally, the funcs.r file in the code folder contains a function that is utilized in the final-project.qmd script for data extrapolation. To reproduce the results, run the wrangling.qmd script first to create the cleaned dataset, and then execute final-project.qmd to generate the final outputs.
